# STIGMERGYFAMILYSTUDIO
•Stigmergy•Family•Studio• is an experimental social format looking at existing design paradigms, productive ecosystems and physical and digital realities; with an eye for the fundamentals and contemporary modes of creative businesses and their  ows —visible and invisible, private and public, material and immaterial, shared and sold, hot and marginal, legal and illegal. It takes its name from three different social systems (stigmergy/network, family/business, studio/school) which have been structuring biological, educational and labour platforms over time and place and at different scales. Trying to merge these elements into an evolutive creative form of learning and working, it acts toward the making of a cross-boundaries experimental design studio whose aim is to interconnect aspects, actors and movements from different societies, cultures, economies and geographies into a self-build, decentralized, productive reality ___________________________________ a HOUSE-alike anybody can be.
